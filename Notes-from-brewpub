        Vol 36 Cert 17502

(88) 2/3/06 email from Jim Pennington (PRA), some other Williams to look for:
        Here are some of the Williams I was referring to who were all of Group 31
        and located in SE KY.

        1) Wm. b.1877 s/o Levi Pennington and Mary Polly
        2) Wm. b.1877 s/o James Pennington and Liza Sizemore
        3) Wm. b.1878 s/o Samuel and Nancy
        4) Wm. b.1879 s/o Andrew and Emily (This Wm. had a brother named Bradley b.1879)
        5) Wm. b. 1880 s/o Green and Elizabeth
                This should not be "Bill", as this Wm was 8/12 when the census
                was taken in June 19, 1880, ie born Sep/Oct 1879.
        6) Wm. Allen b. 1876 s/o Preston
        7) Wm. Roby b.1876 s/o Samuel and Sarah Ann

(89) Nick Pennington Death Cert - V36, page 17912 -
        listed Kenwood House, South Meadowlark Dr, Richmond Ky: 859.623.9472
(90) - If this William is the Bill from the death cert I copied in Frankfort, Mary Polly's last name is Sargeont
        and this may or may not be the right Bill / Billy
(91) - Based on dates, this doesn't look like a possible combination of Pennington/Causey, as this marriage
        is not until 1915, when Nick Sr would have been 18 years old
(92) - Jerry Pennington - 12870 N 500th E, North Manchester IN 46962-8241, 260.982.7967
        use Jessica's email reeceville@hotmail.com
        I spoke to Jerry by phone 2/10/06 at 3PM, he didn't recall going to Elhannon's funeral
        didn't think this was him.  He might remember later.

(121) July 14, 2007 - We were in Corbin for Hannah to be at ODP camp at
        Union College.  We stayed in hotel and decided to wander around.
        we ended up heading over to Bell Cty to try to find Rosa Pennington's
        grave - fat chance.  So we called Dad, he remembered that her
        cemetary was off a gravel road on the left before Ralph Howard's
        store on the road to Blackmont.  Turns out this meant route 72
        that turned off of 119.  Well, we wandered over, found R72 then
        started looking.  We first came to Tacket Hill Cemetary, drove up
        looked around for probably 90 minutes, no love, saw several familiar
        names (Hobbs, Slusher, Howard, but not Rosa.  Then I saw another
        cemetary on the next hill, which turned out to Upland.  We went and
        looked aound there, again familiar names, but no dice.  We wandered
        on up 72 and found Little Howard's grocery.  Wasn't a match, but
        worth a chance.  It had a carwash, so we stopped and asked somebody
        washing his car there, said he thought the owner lived across the
        road.  There didn't appear to be anyone home, and there was a sign
        about a nasty dog, so we moved along.  Went on up 72, til we thought
        we'd gone too far, then stopped at a video store.  Inside was a
        lady in probably 40's, hadn't heard of Howards, but mentioned 2
        more graveyards on 72.  Something and Saylor.  missed the first, but
        wandered saylor, no love.  So were ready to give up, heading back
        up 72 toward 119.  Then when we got back by Little Howards, the
        "owner" was across the street unloading the back of their Tahoe,
        apparently home from the grocery.  We figured what the heck and
        approached him.  Jo Anne asked him about Ralph Howard's store, he
        said it had burned down 3 or 4 years ago (looking later, we
        noticed burned fence posts), and little Howard's was built next
        door by a relative.  Then I told him we were looking for Rose
        Pennington's grave, she was Debbie Slusher's daughter, and he got
        a funny smile on his face.  Turns out this was Johnnie Ray Slusher,
        and Debbie Slusher was his aunt.  He invited us in while he
        finished putting away the groceries, introduced us to his wife,
        then offered to go back up to the graveyard with us.  He seemed
        to know EVERYBODY !!!  We went back up to Tacket Hill, and he was
        able to immediately show us Debbie's grave beside a big Tulip Poplar,
        and Jim Hobbs w/ just a plain stone next to hers, but still couldn't
        find Rose's, though he thought he recalled it.  He still remembered
        Debbie well, and confirmed she used to walk down to the mail boxes
        by Ralph's store everyday to get her mail.  He offered to take us up
        the road to show us where her house used to be.  We wandered a mile
        or so back up the road to a sidestreet on the left called
        "Tuggleswirth" or something like that.  Her house was just up off
        the street back a path off the road.  Then we wandered up the street,
        he said somebody was up there that would know where Rose's grave was.
        We snaked about a quarter mile up to the end, and pulled into
        Mary's driveway.  Johnnie yelled to her that she had some of her
        family here.  She took one look at me and said "Is that N.L.?"
        I told her I was his son and was greeted with a big hug.  Then she
        started asking about him and the rest of the family.  We ended up
        there talking for 2 or 3 hours before it was getting too late, and
        we had to take Johnnie home.  We swapped phone #'s and agreed we'd
        get Dad and at least a few of his brothers to come back down.
        After we dropped Johnnie off, Jo wanted to go back up to Tacket
        to grab a picture of where Rose's stone was.  So we wandered back
        up, got some pics of Debbie's, Jim's and Rose's tree.  Mary also
        had related that Donna / Dony lived to 102 years.

Generation 1

The Pennington Research Association has designated the family descended from Aaron Pennington as Family Group 31.
Each group is designated based on the earliest identifiable ancestor and research begins from that point.

Aaron Pennington (EPHRIAM1) was born about 1786 in North Carolina, and died December 23, 1861 in Harlan Co., Kentu
cky. He married Ann Coldiron about 1806 in Ashe Co., North Carolina. She was born about 1790 in Virginia, and died
 1860 in Harlan Co., Kentucky.

Some researchers have indicated that Aaron was the son of Micajah Pennington. But most research suggests that an E
phriam was Aaron's father. The 1861 Harlan Co., Kentucky Death Records indicate that Aaron died at age 75 and list
 him as the son of Ephriam Pennington.

The 1800 Ashe Co., North Carolina Census lists an Ephriam Pennington on page 85, line 21 with a family group of: 1
 male 10-16 (possibly Aaron}, 1 male 45+ (Ephriam), 1 female 16-26 (unknown) and 1 female 45+ (unknown). Aaron wou
ld have been approximately 13 at that time and any older brothers could have already moved out of the household. T
o date, this is the only family group located which could be Aaron with his father Ephriam.

The 1810 Ashe Co., North Carolina Census, pg. 8A, line 9, lists an A. Pennington with a household of: 2 males unde
r 10 (Levi and Henry), 1 male 16-26 (Aaron) and 1 female 16-26 (Ann). This would be consistent with Aaron and Ann'
s family at that time.

Aaron is listed in the 1815 Tax List for Ashe Co., North Carolina. A William is also listed.

Based on Census Reports and Tax Records it appears Aaron and relocated from North Carolina to Kentucky between 181
5 and 1820. The family settled at Cutshin, then called New Harlan, presently Leslie Co., Kentucky.

Aaron is listed in the 1820 Harlan Co., Kentucky Census, pg. 116, line 240, with a household that matches Aaron, A
nn, Henry, Levi, Ephriam Aaron, Nancy and Malinda.

The Harlan Co., Kentucky Tax Records show Aaron was taxed 1821-1827. William Pennington was taxed 1820-1832. Micaj
ah Pennington was taxed in 1824. Wiliam Pennington (PRA Group 28) and Abigail recorded a 100 acre survey in Harlan
 Co., Kentucky on June 24, 1818. It is unproven if this William is the same William that appears to have moved fro
m North Carolina to Kentucky with Aaron.

Harlan Co., Kentucky Court Records, Deed Book A, Page 171: Aaron Pennington (signed by Amy Pennington) to Elias Sm
ith on August 24, 1826 for $100 - 50 acres part of a 100 acre survey granted to said Pennington on June 24, 1824 o
n the South side of the Poor Fork. Witnessed by A. Lewis and Jonathan Smith. Note: The Amy who signed for Aaron is
 unknown.

Aaron is listed in the 1830 Clay Co., Kentucky Census with a family group that matches Aaron, Ann, Ephriam Aaron,
Nancy, Malinda, Sally, William and Jesse.

Aaron 63 and Ann 60 are listed in the 1850 Harlan Co., Kentucky Census, Dist. #1, Pg. 22A, #169-169 with James (ag
e 18) and Sally (age 17 or 19 born in Virginia). It is speculated that this Sally is Sarah Polly Lewis b. 1830 and
 could have been age 19 at that time.

The 1850 Harlan Co., Kentucky Census lists Ann as 60 years old and born in Virgina. To date there have not been an
y male Coldirons discovered in Virgina in 1790 who could have been Ann's father.

The Harlan Co. Death Records reflect that Aaron Pennington reported the death of Sally Baker age 36 in December 18
55. Although there is a minor conflict with dates, this may have been Aaron's daughter who married Isaac Baker.

Aaron 73 and Ann 60 are listed in the 1860 Harlan Co., Kentucky Census, Harlan Courthouse Post Office, Pg. 91, #58
3 living with their son James (age 29) and wife Sarah (age 30). Note: Ann would have been 70 at the time of this c
ensus and the 60 is believed to be a transcription error. This is the last census data for Aaron and Ann prior the
ir death.

Statements by John Pennington (This may be John b.1868 s/o William or John b.1852 s/o James) recorded in the Diary
 of Rev. John Dickey on Jan. 20, 1898 indicated the following: His Grandfather Aaron Pennington and wife Ann (Cold
iron) came to Kentucky from North Carolina and settled at Cutshin which was then called New Harlan. Their children
's names he remembered were Levi, Jesse, Henry, William, Ephriam Aaron, James, Nancy and Malinda.

Note: Additional information in this interview indicated Aaron's brother may have been Abel (II B). Ref. 1990 Will
is Lake Article "More on Abel II". However, there are some birth year issues with this theory that require additio
nal research.

The Lewis Family Bible listed some of Aaron and Ann's children as Ephriam Aaron, Jesse, Bill (William), Jim (James
) and Linda (Malinda).

Published researcher Otto Coldiron has been researching the Coldiron Family since the early 1970's. He advised tha
t Ann has been one of the most difficult mysteries in the Coldiron Line.

One speculation is that Ann may have married a Coldiron who subsequently died and that she could have used her mar
ried name rather than her maiden name when she married Aaron.

Children of Aaron Pennington and Ann Coldiron are:
  Levi Pennington, b. August 15, 1807, North Carolina; d. September 23, 1894, Burning Springs, Clay Co., Kentucky.
  Henry Pennington, b. 1808, North Carolina; d. between 1880 - 1900, Leslie Co., Kentucky.
  Ephriam Aaron Pennington, b. about 1812, Ashe Co. North Carolina; d. 1884, Perry (now Leslie) Co., Kentucky.
  Nancy Pennington, b. 1815, Ashe Co., North Carolina.
  Malinda Pennington, b. 1820, Virginia or Harlan Co., Kentucky.
  Sarah Sally Pennington, b. 1822, Harlan Co., Kentucky; d. 1853, Harlan Co., Kentucky.
  Jesse Pennington, b. 1824, Harlan Co., Kentucky.
  William Pennington, b. December 1829, Harlan Co., Kentucky; d. after 1900, Leslie Co., Kentucky.
James Pennington, b. January 1831, Harlan Co., Kentucky; d. before 1920.

(132) - Conversation and notes with Howard Bame 5 September 2010, while visiting for Labor Day
We started with the picture of Alex at about 15 in front of a body of water.  Approx 1928/29, Irv was a machinist
at Comet Engraving, got Alex a job as a benchhand.  One of their jobs was the creation of molds for small model
aircraft to assist the government in training military for aircraft recognition, so they therefore has an "exclusi
on" (right word?) from military service.  Irv went to work for Hatz & Merrick engraving, and Alex moved to Dallas
to start Zephyr Engraving.  When Alex moved the family to Dallas, he officially changed the name to BAME to avoid
confusion with Irv's business.  Howard has the official name change form in the safe deposit.  Fred Knab went with
Alex to Dallas to partner in ZE.  The  business was at 3805 Oak Grove, which is now an interstate cloverleaf.
Meanwhile back in Chicago, Merrick retires or is pushed out, and Irv becomes a partner.  Some time later, ZE is
struggling, and they decide to move back to Chicago's west side.  Shortly after they return, a zoning change to
residential forces ZE to move or close.  They decide to merge with Hatz and Irv to form Diekraft, with Hatz, Irv,
Fred, Fred and Alex as partners.  Fred Knab's wife Bernice worked there as secretary.
Howard went to work for DK in Aug53, a few months later Irv died.    Herman Harris
also worked for them until he retired in the late 80s.  Hatz was eventually forced out.  Howard was working as an
apprentice, Herman as a journeyman. Alex died in Feb 1976, and Howard became a benchhand and part owner.  Fred
retired around 1980 and Howard bought him out.  Then Herman was millhand, a guy named Sabino, and Arnie Stern.
Howard retired June 1994, sold DK to Bert Rothstein, Bert kept it running for a while, but struggled with health
issues and eventually closed it down.

of us in our group and the only time we really interact with  each other is at a random funeral.   We're so spread out and everyone is busy, I don't think
we'll all be best buds, but I'd like to re-establish connections.   I don't know where to go from here, just wanted to tell you what I was thinking - Scott
